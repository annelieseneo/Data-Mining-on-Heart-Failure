# Data Mining on Heart Failure

1. Analyse the given full dataset and do the following tasks:

a) Detect the types of noises and anomalies that exist in the full dataset. 

b) Are the attribute dependent or independent? What are the relationship among the variable (attributes)? 

2. Clean the dataset from noises and anomalies using pre-processing techniques. 

3. To predict a heart attack that may happen based on the data of a new patient:

a. Use and modify a piece of program in R that uses your selected algorithm to develop a prediction model for heart attack. 

c. Evaluate and describe the performance of your developed model using accuracy metrics. 

4. Use and modify a piece of program in R to conduct regression modelling.
